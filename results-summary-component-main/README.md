## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Started working with CSS Grid. This help solve/ make progress with some of the spacing issues I had in the summary section while just adding styles to span tags did not work. 

### Continued development

My biggest weakness is responsivensss. I did ok with getting the mobile design match, but as far as adjusting the screen size smaller and smaller, css grid did not work in my favor. I need more practice here. 

Gave those inverse border radiuses ago. They are interesting, but I am far from understanding them. I ended up placing an entire empty div ontop of my summary section to get those curves, hoping I would still be able to manipulate the content using z-index. This ended up removing my ability to get hover states for the continue button. 

Still having issues with screen sizes, taking up the entire screen, with my mobile size, the content width is overflowing. I tried using 100vw and 100vh, something is off. Would appreciate help here! 

Also, didn't understand the color gradients for the background of results half or the score. Was it starting from the middle and working out? Or from the top down?

Thanks for reviewing this code
